    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> 
        My name is Josh Gray, and I am a front-end developer. I obtained my front-end development certificate from Kenzie Academy, where I gained comprehensive training and hands-on experience in developing dynamic websites and applications.
    </p>    
    <p>    After completing the course, my eagerness to learn more led me to dive deeper into specific areas like React and MySQL. I continue to learn and grow as a developer by keeping up with the latest technologies and trends in the industry. 
    </p>    
    <p>    Coding is not just a job for me; it's a passion. I am a quick and eager learner who loves to explore new things and find creative solutions to complex problems. This is why I find myself drawn to the constantly evolving world of programming.
    </p>    
    <p>    I am excited to have found my calling in this career path and look forward to continuously learning and growing as a developer. Thank you for taking the time to read about me, and I look forward to connecting with you soon.</p>
